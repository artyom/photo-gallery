# Web Gallery Generator

Command photo-gallery is a simple web photo gallery generator.

It takes a directory with jpeg images (.jpg or .jpeg suffixes) and produces
HTML file along with two directories: one holds full-sized copies of
original photos, another contains thumbnails. These directories + an HTML
file are compatible with any web server supporting static content.

The default template produces a self-contained gallery using only HTML and
CSS.
